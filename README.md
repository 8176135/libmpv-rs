# mpv-rs
A libmpv abstraction written in rust that#s easy to use and provides the ability to read next to all video and audio codecs.

To get started you need libmpv installed on the system, or enable the "build_libmpv" feature-flag.

For examples see /examples/, which contain usages of general methods, events, and custom protocols.
